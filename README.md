# Honours Project - VRS Investigation
 VR application developed for my honours project. Used to investigate the effects of virtual reality sickness caused by different VR locomotion methods. A potential visual mitigation method was investigated to understand if it could help reduce the effects of VRS.

Build used for testing available at https://gw0001.itch.io/vrs-experiment
